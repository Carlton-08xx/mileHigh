# Welcome to the Lucky Mile!

Your challenge is to write an app that converts miles to feet and back.  There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile, and the index.html file has already been done for you... just write the JavaScript!  To complete the challenge:

1. As you type numbers in the "miles" textbox, the "feet" textbox should update.
2. As you type numbers in the "feet" textbox, the "miles" textbox should update.
3. BONUS CHALLENGE - if the "feet" textbox says "777", show the word "Lucky!" on-screen in the HTML p element with the id="message".

If you're not sure where to start, here is a suggested approach:
1. Psuedo-code (you can see mine in the README.md file in the solution folder)
2. Write JavaScript. Use console.log() as you go to test your code.
3. If you really really don't know where to start, read below (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT):

Try this:

1. Make a function in JavaScript named toFeet.
2. Get the value of the "milesValue" textbox, convert it to feet, and display that value in the "feetValue" textbox.
3. Write a second function named toMiles and do the exact same thing except go from feet to miles instead of miles to feet.
