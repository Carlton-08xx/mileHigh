# Convert Miles to Feet and Back
Here is my psuedo-code:
```
if I type in textbox miles
    read the value of miles
    multuply that value by 5280
    display it in the feet textbox
if I type in textbox feet
    read the value of feet
    divide that value by 5280
    display it in the miles textbox
    if the value of feet is 777,        
    show the word "Lucky!" on the screen
```
